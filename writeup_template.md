**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on the work in a written report

### 1. Pipeline description.

The pipeline I have developed consists of 6 steps.

* First I read the image and converted it to grayscale.

* Gaussian blur is applied to grayscaled image.

* The edges are detected using canny edge detection algorithm. The result is an image with only edges.

* Next I created a region of interest and applied it over the image shown above. In the output I got an image with only the necessary information i.e. lane lines.

![masked](./md%20resources/solidWhiteRight_masked.jpg)

* In order to find out the all the x,y coordinates that belong to the lane lines I took a hough transform of this image. The hough transform provided the coordinates of start & end point of all the lines that are detected in the image.



In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
